# GREMLIN

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GREMLIN is to perform statistical analysis of multipartite networks through a block model approach. 

Multipartite networks  consist in the joint observation of several networks implying some common individuals. The individuals (or entities represented by nodes)  at stake are partitioned into groups defined by their nature.
In what follows, these groups will be referred to as  \emph{functional groups}.


## Installation

You can install the released version of GREMLIN [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#devtools::install_github("Demiperimetre/GREMLIN")
library(GREMLIN)
```

## Mathematical Background

###  A collection of networks

Assume that $Q$ functional groups of individuals are at stake; Let $n_q$ be  the number of individuals  in the $q$-th functional group.

A multipartite network is a collection of networks:  each network may be simple (relations inside  a   functional   group)   or bipartite  (relations between individuals of two  functional groups). We index the collection of networks by pairs of functional groups $(q,q')$. 

The set $E$ denotes  the  list of pairs of  functional groups  for   which we observe an interaction network.

For any pair $(q,q') \in E$, the interaction network is encoded in a matrix  $X^{qq'}$  :  $X^{qq'}_{ii'} \neq 0 $ if there is an edge from unit $i$ of functional group
$q$ to unit $i'$ of functional group $q'$, $0$ otherwise.
    - If $q \neq q'$,   $X^{qq'}$ is  said to be  an \emph{incidence matrix}.
    - $X^{qq}$ is  an \emph{adjacency matrix}:   it is symmetric if the relation inside the functional group $q$  is non-oriented, non-symmetric otherwise.

### A block model


Assume that,   each functional group $q$  is  divided into $K_q$  blocks (or equivalently clusters).  $\forall q\in \{1,\ldots,Q\}$ and  $ \forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}$, let $Z^{q}_i$ be
the latent random variable  such that $Z^ q_i =k$  if individual $i$ of functional group $q$ belongs to cluster $k$.
The random variables $Z^{q}_i$'s are assumed to be independent and  such that: $\forall k \in \{1,\ldots,K_q\}, \forall q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}, \forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mod2}
\Prob(Z^{q}_i=k) = \pi^{q}_k,
\end{equation}
with $\sum_{k=1}^{K_q}\pi^{q}_k=1$,  $\forall q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}$.
Let $\bZ = \left(Z^{q}_i\right)_{i\in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}, q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}}$ denote the set of latent variables.






### Example of a mutualistic ecological network
```{r loading dataset, eval=FALSE}
data = read.csv(file = 'data/ecologicalMPnetwork.csv',header = TRUE,skip = 1)
plantnames = data[,2]
data2 = read.csv(file = 'data/ecologicalMPnetwork.csv',header = FALSE)
type_animals = data2[1,]
type_animals = as.factor(as.character(type_animals[-c(1,2)]))
indflovis = which(data2[1,] == "Floral visitor")
indant = which(data2[1,] == "Ant")
indseed = which(data[1,] == "Seed dispersal")

Adj_flovis = data[,indflovis]
rownames(Adj_flovis) = plantnames
Adj_flovis = as.matrix(Adj_flovis)
Adj_ant = data[,indant]
rownames(Adj_ant) = plantnames
Adj_ant = as.matrix(Adj_ant)
Adj_seed = data[,indseed]
rownames(Adj_seed) = plantnames
Adj_seed = as.matrix(Adj_seed)
```

In this example, the functional groups are plants, floral visitors, ants and birds. 

GREMLIN requires  the global network  be encoded in separate matrices for each network. $3$ incidence matrices. We then format the data to be able to use our R package GREMLIN i.e. we transform the matrices into an list containing    the matrix, its type (incidence, adjacency symmetric, adjacency non symmetric, the functional group in row, the functional group in col). 


```{r transform dataset,  eval=FALSE}
PlantFlovis = defineNetwork(Adj_flovis,"inc","plants","flovis")
PlantAnt = defineNetwork(Adj_ant,"inc","plants","ants")
PlantBird = defineNetwork(Adj_seed,"inc","plants","birds")
```



If you want to keep the names of the species, they should be used as rownames and colnames in the matrices. 

```{r example of dataset, eval=FALSE}
PlantFlovis$mat[1:2,1:2]
```



``` r
Q <- 2
v_NQ = c(30,50)
```





## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GREMLIN)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
